# Planner state — read this first on every new session

_Last updated 2026-09-05 by the bootstrap Planner session (Claude desktop app). This file is a
bootstrap crutch until Quests in the Pak carry this state (step 1.3). Keep it short; update it
whenever a step finishes._

## Where we are

| Step | Status | Landed as |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 0 bootstrap | done | #4 skeleton+CI, #7 shared types, #9 server v0 |
| 1.1 Pak shell + Today | done | #13 next-action + static hosting, #15 shell/theme, #20 Today + SSE + Playwright smoke |
| 1.2 Wake | done | #14 core, #18 channel adapter + `pak_log_event`/`pak_set_next_action`, #21 factory up/down/doctor |
| 1.3 Worlds/Quests, PROTOCOL v1, `pak.*` tools, since-you-looked | **next** | — |
| 1.4 – 1.11 | not started | see factory-spec.md §11 |

## How to work (summary; PROTOCOL.md is authoritative)

- You are the Planner: plan, file issues, review, merge. You do not write app code — Codex does.
- One **project lead subagent per step** (opus). It files issues, runs `codex cloud exec --env
  6a9be268ad288191b44bbdefcbe977ee --branch ...`, reviews the PR, drives fix rounds on the PR
  branch, squash-merges when green. When the step is done, the lead is done.
- Leads must **run** what Codex ships (browser for UI, curl/scripts for services). Codex's
  self-reported checks have been wrong repeatedly; CI is the truth, and CI does not run on a
  PR with merge conflicts ("no checks" = rebase, don't wait).
- Avoid two leads editing the same package at once (lockfile conflicts). Sequence, or split by package.
- Founder decisions (Rumbles) are rare: accounts, money, logins, taste, scope. Otherwise decide,
  build, show working code.

## Environment facts

- Codex environment **ID** `6a9be268ad288191b44bbdefcbe977ee` (label `drufball/wyld` resolves to
  a different, token-less environment — never use the label). `GH_TOKEN` there is a fine-grained
  PAT that **expires around 2026-10-05**; rotating it is a Rumble (account action by Dru).
- `@codex` mentions on GitHub are never used (env-less runs cannot push).
- Planner launch: `pnpm factory:up` → tmux session `wyld`, planner window runs
  `claude --dangerously-load-development-channels server:wake` (the spec's `--channels wake`
  does not work in the research preview; see reference/channels.md). First run needs the
  "Use this MCP server" confirmation for `wake`.
- No branch protection (Free plan, private repo) — Dru chose convention: only the Planner merges,
  only green.
- TypeScript pinned 6.0.3 (typescript-eslint peer range). Tailscale is logged out on the laptop
  (needed at 1.11 → Rumble then).

## Open items

- Pak theme is a clean baseline, not yet the chunky bevelled console look — planned for 1.11
  unless Dru asks sooner.
- Pak `LiveEventsProvider` keeps `lastEvent` in provider state (needless re-render per event);
  remove when 1.3 consumes events per kind.
- Service-worker registration errored in the sandboxed in-app browser; unconfirmed on a real phone.
- Upstream channel bugs: notifications may not reach an idle session (anthropics/claude-code
  #36827, #45563, #61797). If nothing arrives after an intent, suspect that first.
